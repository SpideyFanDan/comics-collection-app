# comics-collection-app

## Project Description

A comic book collection app that allows a collector to search for comic books they own and add them to a database to manage their personal collection.
The app uses Django and Python to create an API that stores the collection information for individual users, and React and Bootstraps on the front end with a search function that pulls from the Comic Vine API.
